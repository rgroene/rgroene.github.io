				<h1><strong>Classroom Management Strategies</strong></h1>
				<p>
				<strong>Behavior</strong><br /><br />
				My policy for classroom behavior basically comes down to respect. I will be respectful to my students, and I expect them to be respectful to me, as well as their fellow classmates.
				Behaviors that are disruptive and hinder my ability to teach and/or students' ability to learn, therefore, require redirection. I do want my students to have fun in my class, and when
				doing independent work, I do not necessarily expect them to be silent, but I do expect them to focus on their work and not to distract other students who are working (even when finished with their own work).
				Rather than simply laying down rules and dispensing penalties in a mechanical fashion, I will strive to create a community of respect and to encourage students to help students to understand when (as well as why)
				their behavior is not respectful. The sort of behavior that I absolutely will not tolerate at all is bullying or behavior that makes other students feel unsafe or uncomfortable (e.g., the use of racial slurs or other derogatory language).
				When necessary, I will make use of formal disciplinary action, but I would like to avoid such an approach whenever possible, as it has the potential to create an antagonistic relationship between the teacher and the students.
				<br /><br /><br />
				
				<strong>Participation and Student Engagement</strong><br /><br />
				While I will sometimes ask for volunteers, I also recognize that not all students will volunteer of their own accord. Because I want all of my students to be active participants in the process of learning, I make use of several strategies
				to ensure that all students are engaged. Sometimes, I will simply go around the room calling on each students or call on students in a somewhat random order. I also believe that having students work together in groups encourages students
				to engage with one another even when they might be nervous speaking before the entire class. Because I do want to be sensitive to students who are shy and have social anxiety, I also like to make use of a variety of methods of response.
				For instance, at times, I have passed out mini-whiteboards and given students the option to show their answer on their whiteboards rather than saying it aloud.
				<br /><br /><br />
				
				<em>Evidence of Classroom Management</em><br />
				In the Latin classes that I taught at Camp Hill High School, students have generally been pretty well-behaved. I have had an issue though of certain students getting done with their work before other students and then becoming overly talktative
				and distracting towards other students. Therefore, I have started to specify in advance what kinds of activities students should work on after they are finished with their work. At times, these activities are more specific (e.g., any Latin-related activity
				or studying for an upcoming quiz/test), while others are more open-ended (e.g., any academic activity, including doing work for other classes). In terms of management, one of my biggest challenges was the Career class that I taught for two weeks at Camp Hill.
				Unlike my Latin class, every 8th grader has to take the Career class, and it was also a class of about 30 students. In that environment, I had to be very intentional in telling the students that they should not be talking while doing individual work. While some quiet
				conversation while doing individual work is acceptable in some cases, in that particular class, it had a tendency to get out of hand far too quickly.
