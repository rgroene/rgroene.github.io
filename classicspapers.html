				<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
				<p>During my time at Kent State University, I completed many research papers in the field of classics, most of which
				focus on Latin texts. First and foremost, I would like to present my lengthy Master's thesis, entitled
				"Narratives of Paradise, Decline, and Restoration In Roman and Early Christian Texts: A Comparison," which is available <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/r/etd/search/10?p10_accession_num=kent169972358464896&clear=10&session=635198104627">here</a>.
