				<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
				<p>Salve! Mihi nomen est Magister Ryan Groene. I am a prospective Latin teacher, ideally looking to teach high school students at all grade levels.
				My first teaching experience consisted of teaching Latin I to undergraduates at Kent State University as a graduate assistant. Since then, I have also completed ____ weeks of student teaching 
				at Camp Hill Middle/High School (grades 8-12) and Central Dauphin High School (grades 9-12), in order to obtain my PA teaching licensure (including certification in both Latin and Language Arts).</p>
				<p>Here is a summary of my educational background:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Albright College - Will be earning my teaching certification (both Latin and Language Arts) at the end of 2025 by taking grad classes and student teaching</li>
					<li>Kent State University - Graduated in 2023 with an MA in Latin</li>
					<li>Boston University - Graduated in 2021 with a Master of Sacred Theology (STM)</li>
					<li>Regent College - Graduated in 2019 with an MA in theological studies</li>
					<li>Taylor University - Graduated in 2010 with a BS in computer science</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I have a love of languages and of ancient Greco-Roman history and culture that I look forward to sharing with my students.</p>
				<br />
				
				<!--<p><strong>My Journey with Educational Technology</strong></p>
				<p> I created this website for my Educational Technology class at Albright College. As I am a computer science major who worked in web development for six years,
				I went into this class being fairly comfortable with technology. Nonetheless, I was not familiar with much of the technology that is commonly used in educational contexts.
				Through this class, I became more familiar with the following technologies:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>ChatGPT - experimented with it and read articles about the controversy surrounding it in educational contexts</li>
					<li>Nearpod - used to create an interactive presentation for students</li>
					<li>Screencastify - used to create several videos</li>
					<li>Google Classrooms - used to create a learning module</li>
					<li>Google Maps - specifically creating maps with it</li>
					<li>Google Slides - though I still prefer PowerPoint</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In addition to these technologies, there were other technologies that were introduced that I did not look into. However, I copied pasted links relating to these technologies
				to a document so that I can potentially come back to them later.</p>-->
