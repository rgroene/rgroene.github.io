				<p>Salve! Mihi nomen est Magister Ryan Groene. I am a prospective Latin teacher, ideally looking to teach high school students at all grade levels.
				While I have not yet taught high school students, I will be student teaching in the fall, and I did teach Latin I to undergraduate students as a graduate assistant.</p>
				<p>Here is a summary of my educational background:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Albright University - Will be earning my teaching certification (both Latin and Language Arts) at the end of 2025 by taking grad classes and student teaching</li>
					<li>Kent State University - Graduated in 2023 with an MA in Latin</li>
					<li>Boston University - Graduated in 2021 with a Master of Sacred Theology (STM)</li>
					<li>Regent College - Graduated in 2019 with an MA in theological studies</li>
					<li>Taylor University - Graduated in 2010 with a BS in computer science</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Basically, I have a love of languages and of ancient Greco-Roman history and culture that I look forward to sharing with my students.</p>
