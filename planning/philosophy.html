				<h1><strong>Teaching Philosophy </strong></h1>
				<p>
					Thinking back to all of the classes that I took in high school, one observation consistently comes to mind:
					I was a high-achieving student who liked to learn and strived to earn good grades, yet, by my late-thirties, I
					have retained very little of the knowledge that I learned in these classes. In language classes, in particular, it
					is common to hear people say that they took so-and-so language in college, but they remember little to nothing. My
					own experience has caused me to reflect on the purpose of high school education. While I would love to find out that my
					teaching inspired some students to continue down the path of classical studies, with the goal of either becoming a classics
					scholar or somebody who enjoys reading classical texts in their spare time, I realize that few, if any, of my students will
					pursue this path after high school. So then, what is the point? What do I hope for students to gain by taking my classes?
					<br />
					On the one hand, a study of Latin can be helpful for expanding one's English vocabulary, due to the number of English words derived
					from Latin. It can also make the future study of other languages (especially Romance languages) easier for those who are so inclined.
					I do hope that students will at least retain some of what they learn in my classes. Therefore, I will strive to do all I can to make learning
					engaging and relevant, taking student feedback into account, and trying to focus on those elements of Roman culture and history that students
					find to be most interesting. I also believe it is important to make connections between the ancient world and the modern one, challenging students
					to think critically and to think about what relevant a knowledge of Roman society may have to how they think about modern-day society.
					<br />
					On the other hand, even beyond the specific facts that high schoolers learn, I believe that high school education can and should be formative.
					Teachers should seek to know and understand their students personally and consider how they can encourage them to develop and pursue their interests.
					Teachers should seek to model compassion, integrity, and good character, while being attentive to students' social-emotional development, which is always
					intertwined with their intellectual development. In terms of intellectual development itself, the role of a teacher is not simply to get students to memorize
					a bunch of facts (which they will likely soon forget anyway), but to encourage them to think critically, analytically, and creatively. This involves, for instance,
					making connections between their learning about the Romans and their own experiences, evaluating what hidden motives might lie behind carefully crafted rhetoric,
					or evaluating the reasoning of Roman authors.
					<br />
					As a result, I think it is important that, as early as possible, the Latin texts that students work on translating are also teaching them something about Roman
					culture or history. I also think that using texts that are simplified distillations or adaptations of the writings of classical authors is helpful, even before
					the student reaches the point of being able to read actual historical texts. While I do believe that mastery of Latin requires the memorization of inflectional endings,
					I also realize that it is easy for students to get bogged down with a long list of endings to memorize and to memorize charts without really understanding the significance
					of those charts. Therefore, I do not plan on making students memorize every chart that they encounter, as I want to place more emphasis on the actual significance behind
					the various endings (e.g., what case, number, gender, voice, mood, etc., actually <em>mean</em>). Thus, while rote memorization will not be entirely absent from my classes,
					it will not be emphasized as much as it traditionally has been in Latin classrooms.
