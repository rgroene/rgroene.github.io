						Camp Hill High School, Latin V, Response to Julius Caesar</a>
						- This assignment is 1 of the 3 unit projects that students could choose for my Julius Caesar unit. The assignment was to write a 2-page response
						to Caesar's Gallic War from the perspective of a Roman senator either defending or condemning Caesar's actions. The student also must write a short summary
						of his argument in Latin. See also the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-p99as1T-N3iZog2Z-1-uVXL9azFBLcQ/view?usp=sharing">Unit Project Options and Rubric</a>

						<strong>Camp Hill High School, Latin III, Student poetry in Latin</strong>
						- In Latin III, I gave students the option of either doing exercises from the book or doing a creative writing assignment that included vocabulary and grammar
						from that chapter. One student opted to write poems for the creative writing assignment. The grammar in these stories is not perfect, but I thought the poems were
						very creative, and they do demonstrate an understanding of the vocabulary and grammar that was the focus of their respective chapters. If I do this assignment in the future,
						I may require students to submit a revised story or poem after I go through and explain where the grammar is incorrect.
						Some of these poems are linked below:
