				<h1><strong>Instructional Strategies</strong></h1>
				<p>
				<strong>Methods</strong><br /><br />
				I make use of a variety of different educational methods in order to maximize student engagement and encourage active learning. Here are some of the activities I have done with students:
				<ul>
					<li>Textbook exercises</li>
					<li>Additional worksheets that I find or create</li>
					<li>Creative writing assignments</li>
					<li>PowerPoint Presentations</li>
					<li>Whiteboard exercises, where I have all students write their answers on whiteboards</li>
					<li>Acting out Latin sentences in groups (e.g., having one student be the subject and another being the direct object)</li>
					<li>Review Jeopardy</li>
					<li>Other Review Games (e.g., Kahoot, Gimkit, Blooket)</li>
					<li>Edpuzzles (especially for history, culture, and mythology)</li>
					<li>Online review exercises (where student receives immediate feedback)</li>
				</ul>
				<br /><br />
				
				<strong>Differentiation</strong><br /><br />
				While student teaching, some of my differentiation strategies have involved providing students with options. Here are some examples:
				<ul>
					<li>In Latin III, I gave students the option of completing a creative writing assignment that covered the vocab and grammar for the chapter as an alternative to doing some or all of their textbook exercises.</li>
					<li>In Latin V, I provided students with a variety of options for unit projects for my Julius Caesar unit. See <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-p99as1T-N3iZog2Z-1-uVXL9azFBLcQ/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</li>
					<li>In various courses, I have given students the option of writing their answers on whiteboards rather than saying them aloud.</li>
				</ul>
				In the future, I hope to think of more ways to provide students with more agency in their education. Another form of differentiation is simply making use of a wide variety of different types of activities,
				and some of the activities that I have made use of are described above under "Methods."<br /><br />
				
				My time at Central Dauphin helped me to better understand another element of differentiation. At that school, the teacher made more of an effort to make her classes accessible to a wider range of students,
				and, as a result, there was more variation in terms of skill level (many more IEP students, including students in learning support). Through this experience, I learned to tailor questions to students' skill levels.
				For instance, if I am working on a translation, I might ask one student to simply try their best to translate a clause. With another student, I may walk through each of the steps one by one or ask the student
				specific questions about the words in the sentence before moving on to a translation. Another differentiation strategy is to come up with additional enrichment tasks for students who finish tasks earlier than others.
