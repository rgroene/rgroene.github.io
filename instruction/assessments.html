				<h1><strong>Assessments</strong></h1>
				<p>At the time of compiling this portfolio, I no longer have access to the majority of assessments I created for my students at Camp Hill High School, 
				as I create them online through the school's LMS (Schoology), which I can no longer access. However, I have included the paper/pencil assessments that I put together
				while working as a student teacher at Camp Hill High School. Chapters specified above are from the textbook <em>Ecce Romani</em> </p>
				<br />
				<p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
				<p>So far, in most cases, I have been pleased with the results of my quizzes, as they have shown that students are effectively learning the material. Sometimes, however, they have also helped
				to highlight students who are struggling. In Latin I, there were a few students that I found to be struggling with the material. One of these students did do well on the next quiz, after I had
				some one-on-one instructional time with her. For another, student, it became clear to me that she was not studying (given that she was able to recall very little of the vocabulary). Through informal,
				formative assessment, I noticed that students in Latin III struggled with pronouns, so that is why I decided to give the Pronoun Quiz linked below. In hindsight, I think I also should have spent more time in class
				reviewing pronouns as the grades on the Pronoun Quiz were generally not very good (in spite of the detailed study guide I included on Schoology).
				I also realize now how important it is to plan out summative assessments in advance, as I found with my Latin V class that it was difficult to ensure that my mid-unit and unit superquizzes/exams were at
				an appropriate difficulty level.
